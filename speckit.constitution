# Stock Tracker Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. API-First Architecture
Every feature starts with external API integration; APIs must be properly abstracted, independently testable, and documented; Clear data contracts required - no direct API calls without service layer.

### II. Data Processing Pipeline
Every service exposes functionality via standardized data flow; Input validation → Processing → Output formatting; Support both real-time and batch processing modes.

### III. Error Handling (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Comprehensive error handling mandatory: Exception handling → User notification → Logging; Graceful degradation for API failures strictly enforced.

### IV. Integration Testing
Focus areas requiring integration tests: Wildberries API contract tests, Google Sheets API integration, Data synchronization between services, Stock tracking accuracy.

### V. Observability & Logging
Structured logging for all API calls and data operations; Performance monitoring for stock updates; Error tracking and alerting for failed API requests.

## Technology Stack

**Core Language**: Python
**External APIs**: 
- Wildberries API (marketplace data)
- Google Sheets API (data export/reporting)
**Architecture**: Service-oriented with clear API abstractions

## Development Workflow

All code must follow API-first principles; Integration tests required for external API changes; Performance testing for stock tracking operations; Code review must verify error handling completeness.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other development practices; All PRs must verify API integration compliance; External API changes require impact assessment and testing plan.
